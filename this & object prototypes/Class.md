`class` does a very good job of pretending to fix the problems with the class/inheritance design pattern in JS. But it actually does the opposite: **it hides many of the problems, and introduces other subtle but dangerous ones**.

In some respects, it asks more questions than it answers, and it feels in totality like a very unnatural fit on top of the elegant simplicity of the `[[Prototype]]` mechanism.
